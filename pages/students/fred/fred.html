                <p class="justify">Our first trips we traveled with the study abroad leaders in a large group of 17, frankly overwhelming a metro cart. My classmates and I began using 
                    Google Maps on Day 2 and could reach anywhere even kilometers away quickly without fear of getting lost in an unknown area. A major concern with a metro was cellular 
                    service to secure the map connection. To my surprise, even through the tunnels the maps could begin or refresh almost anywhere.

                <p class="justify"> I am grateful to have packed my walking shoes for the trip. The first day alone we walked
                    30,000 steps. Above is a historic statue from one day our group spent exploring the historic downtown Madrid. 
                    I was impressed that each street seemingly throughout the city had highly detailed designs on outer walls. 
                    The city prides itself on beautiful artwork of many kinds including architecture.

                <p class="justify">My favorite technology from the trip surprisingly occured at a restaurant in Downtown Madrid.
                    While I have seen QR Codes on tables, this establishment took the ordering and payment process to another level. 
                    The Study Abroad group and I scanned the code to pick Italian food for lunch one day. I had delicious pizza. At checkout,
                    many Spanish restaurants struggled to handled 8 or more checks like can be the case in the United States. What impressed me so much
                    was reopening the QR Code website to pay and being able to select which items from the total party's bill I would like to pay. 
                    I could also pay for these items on my phone. After my purchase was complete, the rest of the table could see both the complete bill
                    but also the smaller total amount of outstanding items. I believe many American restaurants should implement this technology to reduce
                    server workload in the dining experience.

                <p class="justify">During our time in Barcelona, I experienced my first professional soccer game. Before the kickoff,
                    several guys on the trip and I bought jerseys from Pedri, an young and promising player. With this newfound connection, 
                    we hoped to see him play and maybe score a goal. Unfortunately, he did not start so we dampened those expectations and enjoyed 
                    a tight 1-0 first half. To our surprise, he checked in last in the game and proceeded to score 2 goals in a matter of 15 minutes.
                    Our whole group was ecstatic!
