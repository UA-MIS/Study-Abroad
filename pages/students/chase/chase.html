                <p class=" justify">With this study abroad trip being my first time outside the U.S. I have to say that
                    I was not sure what to expect. This class presented a phenomenal opportunity for me to take that
                    leap of stepping outside the country and achieving something high on my bucket list. </p>

                <blockquote><i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i> <span class="quote">They just kept feeding me lemons, I
                        couldn't make them stop even if I wanted to. <span class="author">Chase</span></span>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="justify">After reflecting on my time abroad, I can confidently say it has been a truly
                    formative experience for me. I am a big proponent of the idea that you learn and grow the most when
                    you are positioned outside your comfort zone. By immersing ourselves in a culture and language that
                    was unknown to us, we accomplished this with extraordinary success. </p>

                <h3 class="left">Getting to Spain</h3>
                <p class="justify">Our program was structured so that we were responsible for getting to and from Spain.
                    I had never booked a flight to another country, so I really had no idea what to expect. We were all
                    surprised, though, when we did a simple google search and we were provided with a variety of options
                    to choose from that Google found for us.</p>

                <p class="justify">
                    Google was able to infer that I am looking for a flight based on my search and pull in live
                    information from all the major airlines and present me with an organized and easy-to-consume table
                    of flights. There is a great deal of effort that has to go into making that process as seamless as
                    possible. The number of systems that are communicating with each other for that to be accurate and
                    easy is truly remarkable.
                </p>

                <h4 class="left">Utilizing Multiple Airliess</h4>

                <p class="justify">
                    While Google was able to provide a smooth experience while searching for a preferred flight, we did
                    not have a similar experience with actually checking in and viewing information for our flights.
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    Many of us flew American Airlines for BHM to RDU and RDU to BOS and Iberia Airlines for BOS to MAD.
                    American and Iberia have a partnership to cover international trips such as these. American does
                    their best to integrate their mobile app with Iberia, however, there were many issues that arose.
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    For one, it was not clear how exactly we were to check into our flights with Iberia and how we might
                    ensure that we had properly checked in. While the American Airlines app allowed us to view our
                    flight from BOS to MAD, it did not allow us to interact with it through their app. Instead, we had
                    to install the Iberian app to handle our flight there. The only issue with this is that their app
                    has many issues and is not user friendly. Most of us had to resort to visiting their web app to
                    check in as opposed to just using their app, and some of us were still not able to check in before
                    arriving at the gate.
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    When traveling abroad, you would like for this process to be intuitive and user friendly. Thís poor
                    experience highlighted to us the stark differences in how different companies are able to integrate
                    with other services. Going back to Google’s flight information, we were able to search, view, and
                    book our flights seamlessly. However, with American’s integration with Iberia, it was clunky and
                    broken in many aspects. The need for smooth integration between different systems was apparent to us
                    after enduring this.
                </p>

                <h3 class="left">Exploring Cities</h3>
                <p class="justify">Throughout our journey, we spent 7 days in Madrid and Barcelona each. Going into this trip I was concerned with how we would go about traveling and experiencing the rich experiences that these cities have to offer. I thought that we would be mostly dependent on our guides in taking us from place to place and guiding us through our time there. However, there was significant free time built into our schedule, taking this option off the table for much of our time there. Instead, we pushed ourselves to find things to do and venture out into the city on our own every day. </p>

                <h4 class="left">Getting Around Cities</h4>
                <p class="justify">One piece of technology that assisted us in getting from point to point was Google’s and Apple’s map services. They offered phenomenal integration with the public transportation system that was available in each of these cities. Outlining which metro/bus line to take and exactly the number of stops we were to remain on the line for. Beyond that, it also provided us with a variety of options that we could choose from and an estimated time for each, which tended to be accurate more times than not. </p>
            <p class="justify">We were not only surprised that it was able to show us the potential routes in a foreign nation, using their public options, but also show the most efficient route by intermingling the use of both metro and bus lines.  </p>

            <h4 class="left">
                Handling Communication
            </h4>
            <p class="justify">As you probably already know, Spain is mostly a Spanish speaking country. While there are many who can speak English, this was not something that we were able to rely on during our trip. There were also many instances of us having to interpret menus that were entirely in Spanish. One phenomenal tool that we were able to rely on was Google Translate. By simply taking a picture of the text, it was able to parse the information and provide a decent translation in English of what information was being relayed to us. </p>

            <p class="justify">This worked so well, that when we took pictures of multiple languages in one picture (Ex: Menus that may have both Spanish and Italian on it) it was still able to provide us with the English translation of both. Being able to analyze these pictures and quickly provide an answer back to the end user is a testament to their infrastructure and back-end capabilities that can perform these searches so quickly. </p>
            <h3 class="left">Enjoying the Sites</h3>
            <p class="justify">After we got our bearings straight and figured out how to navigate the cities, we really began to enjoy ourselves. We got to see so many beautiful and historic sites, explore a wide array of cuisines, and meet many different people with such diverse back grounds. I will include some of my favorite photos from the trip below outlining some of these things!</p>

            <h3 class="left">Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="justify">After reflecting on my experiences abroad, I believe that this has been such a phenomenal time of growth for myself. My confidence increased after entering unknown territory and discovering joy in it all. My perspective on the world, through interactions of unfamiliar cultures, has grown deeper and richer from my time abroad. For anyone who can go abroad, I say to you go, you will not regret it! </p>
