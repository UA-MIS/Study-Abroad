            I was eager to explore Spain, one of the first things I noticed was
            a strong commitment to renewable energy and clean technology. The
            country is clearly focused on efficiency, utilizing mass public
            transportation and technology to better the average persons day. The
            experience of navigating a new culture, especially one where I
            didn't speak the language, was both challenging and rewarding. I
            struggled at first with ordering food and buying things, but quickly
            learned some phrases, embraced the countries navigation system and
            started using google translate a bit too much.

          <h3 class="left">The Innovations of Spain....</h3>
          <p class="justify">
            Spain seamlessly integrates technology into daily life, making it
            incredibly convenient for both residents and tourists. One standout
            innovation is the use of QR codes in restaurants and cafes. You can
            scan a code at your table to view the menu, order, and pay directly
            from your phone, helping us non-natives with translations and taking
            the hardest part out of ordering food if you don't count choosing
            where to eat. Contactless payment methods are also widespread,
            allowing quick payments where the employee never takes your card out
            of sight. Spain's metro and train systems are highly efficient, one
            of our guides said you can reach almost any destination within
            Madrid in under 30 minutes. The country's commitment to
            sustainability is shown with electric buses, trains, and even ubers
            (electric ubers were way cheaper than combustion engine
            alternatives). These innovations make navigating and enjoying
            Spain's cities easier and more enjoyable, enabling someone who knows
            near zero Spanish to get around and enjoy the country.

        <div class="content center">
          <p class="justify">
            Spain's commitment to renewable energy was clear, on the train we
            saw fields of solar panels and wind turbines, along with with one
            nuclear power plant. This focus on clean energy goes alongside the
            efficiency seen elsewhere in Spain, this shift towards clean energy
            seems to be more recent as smaller and less modern areas were still
            based almost solely on carbon fuels. What truly stood out to me,
            though, was the incredible diversity of food. The cities are a
            melting pot of foods from various cultures. I loved the variety, but
            my favorite was the Spanish Omelette. The Spanish Omelette was one
            of the simplest dishes that nearly every restaurant served, it will
            soon be cooked in Alabama (hopefully we will do it justice)! The
            ability to see and experience such different cultures within such a
            small time-frame was truly a once in a lifetime experience.
