                <p class=" justify">When I first heard about the opportunity to study abroad, I knew it would be an incredible 
                chance to explore new destinations, immerse myself in different cultures, and connect with fellow MIS students 
                in an environment beyond the classroom.</p>

                <h3 class="left">Technology in Spain</h3>
                <p class="justify">One piece of technology that fascinated me was from the popular apparel brand UNIQLO. In their stores, 
                    they use tiny RFID tags on the clothes, which communicate with the Point of Sale system to automatically identify what you bought 
                    and how much it costs. This innovation made the self-checkout process incredibly easy and touchless, eliminating the need 
                    for manual scanning and streamlining the entire experience.
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    To use the system, you simply place the items you intend to buy in a box next to the Point of Sale (POS) system. 
                    The box reads the RFID tags and sends the information to the machine. All you need to do is scan your credit card, 
                    and you're done.
                </p>
                
                <p class="justify">
                    I believe this technology could significantly speed up the self-checkout process. Stores with high customer 
                    traffic could utilize this system to reduce checkout times, enhance customer satisfaction, and encourage repeat business.
                </p>

                <h3 class="left">Lessons</h3>

                <p class="justify">
                    While abroad, we had a series of lessons and company visits planned that enhanced our learning experience beyond 
                    the classroom. In Madrid, we visited a company specializing in cyber security. Before this visit, I had limited 
                    knowledge of the topic, so it was fascinating to explore the world of cyber threats and defenses. We learned about 
                    various security terms and concepts, and the experts explained how they handle potential incidents, from detection to 
                    response. This firsthand insight into the fast-paced and critical field of cyber security was both eye-opening and 
                    educational.
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    While in Barcelona, we attended a lesson from another cyber security professional who provided a hands-on 
                    demonstration of a software. His lesson inspired me to look deeper into online protection, where I discovered that 
                    nothing on the internet is truly private. This eye-opening experience emphasized the importance of cyber security 
                    in our daily lives.
                </p>

                <h3 class="left">Exploring Cities</h3>
                <p class="justify">
                    Madrid is very different from any other big cities I've ever been too. It was the cleanest city ever there was hardly 
                    any trash, grafitti, and I generally always felt safe. The coolest part about the cities is how well connected they are 
                    by the subway and busses. We were given public transportation cards which turned out to be extremely helpful. We used 
                    public transportation at least twice a day and it was awesome.
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    At first it was extremely confusing but we figured out you can use google and apple maps to find your way around. 
                    We would put in our starting and ending point and select 'Transit' and apples / googles software would do the rest for us! 
                    It would tell us where to go which subway line to get on where to get off which bus to take. It really made life a lot easier.
                </p>

                <h3 class="left">Other Adventures</h3>
                <p class="justify">
                    Every day, we continued our learning journey by going on tours, trying local dishes and tapas, engaging with the locals, 
                    and immersing ourselves in their culture and civilization. One of the highlights was touring the Royal Palace of Madrid, 
                    where we explored various rooms used by the Spanish royal family. These experiences enriched our understanding of the 
                    local heritage and added a fun and educational aspect to our trip.
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    In Barcelona, we toured the Sagrada Familia, a breathtaking basilica still under construction that stands out 
                    dramatically from the rest of the city. Upon entering, we were overwhelmed by the immense scale and complex design 
                    of the interior. We also attended a Barcelona soccer game, an experience unlike any other. The atmosphere was 
                    intimidating and loud, and the thrill when Barcelona scored was unforgettable. These moments left a lasting 
                    impression on me and added a thrilling element to our trip.
