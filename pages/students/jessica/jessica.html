                <p class=" justify">For my first time in Europe, I could not imagine a better way to experience it than with the MIS program. 
                    Not only did we get to explore Spain, meet with businesses, and evaluate new information systems - 
                    but we also got to make new friendships within the MIS family, which was arguably the most rewarding part. </p>

                </blockquote>

                <p class="justify">Looking back on the two weeks we spent in Spain, I am certain that the growth and knowledge you gain from traveling, 
                    is simply nothing a classroom could ever teach. 
                    You could do as much research about a foreign place as possible, yet you truly don’t know it until you put your feet on the ground. </p>

                <h3 class="left">Preparing for the Trip</h3>
                <p class="justify">As I started to prepare for the trip, it struck me that I had never been immersed in a place where I did not speak the main language. 
                    Sure I had been to Mexico - on a resort where everyone spoke English - but this was going to be a trip where we were the outsiders. 
                    No one going was fluent in Spanish, and it was an exciting fear to have knowing that we would be lost exploring. </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    As far as actually preparing, we did a little research on differences we needed to be aware of, partially with packing. 
                    I bought power adapters for all of my plugins, and we had been warned that curling irons and flat irons made in the US tended to be fried by European power outlets (spoiler, my roommate and I’s curling iron lasted one day before giving out). 
                    Aside from power, my biggest concern was the lack of free and available water - going from having my Stanley cup with me 24/7, to getting one tiny glass of water with each meal, was definitely a shock. 
                </p>

                <h4 class="left">Utilizing Apple Maps</h4>

                <p class="justify">
                    Both Madrid and Barcelona offered many ways of transportation which was originally very daunting as
                     we did not have much experience navigating a metro or bus system.
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    Once we arrived we were given transportation passes that allowed us to use the metro and the bus, and our tour guide gave us a brief description 
                    of how to navigate each. When we arrived at the metro for the first time, we found the signs very confusing - 
                    even the ones that were supposed to update as trains came in and out, tended to be slow and misguided. 
                    This led us to utilize the metro application on Apple Maps.
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    This application would allow you to put in your destination, just as if you were driving there, and give you directions to the metro stop you should go to, which train to get on, and how many stops to ride. 
                    This was much more efficient than trying to decipher the signs posted within the metro station. The issue was once we got on the metro, our phones would lose service and we wouldn't be able to track where we were on the map. 
                    In this scenario, it would’ve been extremely helpful to have digital maps within the metro car that updated as you moved along the route. 
                </p>

                <p class="justify">
                    We quickly found that we enjoyed the buses much more than the metros. While the buses were much smaller and sometimes hard to fit the entire group in, it was a great way to get to see the city as you traveled to your destination. 
                    Many times while we were on route to our current location, we would find new places we wanted to visit just by looking out the bus window.
                </p>




                <h3 class="left">Differences Between Cities</h3>
                <p class="justify">Our group spent one week in both Madrid and Barcelona, and we were surprised by many differences between the two cities. </p>

                <p class="justify">My comparison would be that if they had to be compared to US cities, Madrid would be New York and Barcelona would be LA. 
                    Starting in Madrid was a wonderful way to ease into Spanish culture - it was an Urban atmosphere that was used to tourists and often renovated, 
                    many streets looked like they could’ve been in the US. This was a great way to be introduced to Spain, as we had the comfortability of an 
                    atmosphere we were used to, but also learned to navigate the language barrier and cultural differences. Madrid by far had the best public 
                    transportation system any of us had ever seen - there is truly no need to own a car if you live in Madrid.
                </p>

                <p class="justify">Barcelona had a more historic feel to it - there were the buildings you would expect to see in Europe that definitely did not 
                    resemble anything in the US, and also the coastline which provided both beach day fun, and a massive industrial port. Compared to Madrid, 
                    Barcelona was much more geared to tourists; there were souvenir shops on ever corner, and the shops and restaurants spoke wonderful English. 
                    We enjoyed tours of the city as well as walks along the beach!
                </p>


                <h4 class="left">Seeing the Sights</h4>
                <p class="justify">Almost every tour we did in both cities was guided either by our designated WorldStrides lead, or a guide specific to the attraction. 
                    We all agreed how beneficial it was to have someone walk around with us and explain the significance of what we were seeing. 
                    Whereas if we had just walked around by ourselves and thought oh that’s a pretty building, with a guide we learned the significance, the story, 
                    and the importance of each location. All of the tours were like one big interactive history lesson, it was fascinating to learn the story of the 
                    city by walking through it.
                </p>
            <p class="justify">After each tour we were always given time to explore the area by ourselves. 
                We would fill this time by finding a new restaurant to try, shopping around at local stores, and going back to see our favorite parts of the tour. 
                This method of tour and free time provided the perfect experience - we received the benefits of learning our surroundings, then tested the waters by 
                exploring by ourselves. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="left">Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="justify">This trip left me with an excitement about exploring the world - just being in Europe knowing there were so many countries and 
                cultures close by made me determined to come back one day and explore as much as possible. While this was only a three hour credit class, the 
                impact made will last a lifetime. I am so thankful to have been on this adventure and cannot wait for the next one!
