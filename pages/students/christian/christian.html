                <p class=" justify">An adventurous moment, mixed with utter excitement; after 25 years of having the
                    infamous Iron Ore Train on my bucket list, I finally parked my car in front of one of the sheds in a
                    dusty side street in the outskirts of Nouadhibou, where the responsible officials spend their
                    working hours. So here I was, walking into the shed of the Mauritanian Railway Authorities to
                    enquire about the possibility to transport my car and myself to Choum, approximately 500 km east of
                    Nouadhibou.</p>

                <blockquote><i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i> <span class="quote">They just kept feeding me lemons, I
                        couldn't make them stop even if I wanted to. <span class="author">christian</span></span>
                </blockquote>

                <p class="justify">I wanted to get an overview of one of the most dilapidated cities I had ever seen.
                    This is where Iron Ore Train ends, one of the longest trains in the world, which makes Nouadhibou
                    the most important area in poor Mauritania.</p>

                    The deal was done in the blink of an eye. With one place still available, I could put my car on the
                    train. I only had to decide immediately, since the train was about to leave. I quickly checked my
                    water and food supply, which would last for some days and gave it a go. 120 Euros for the car plus
                    myself was a fair price and within the next couple of minutes, my car was loaded and tied to a
                    platform for vehicles. My ticket said no passengers in the car, but nobody obliged when I asked if I
                    could spend the journey in or on the car. I started making arrangements for the coming 30 hours:
                    water, food, snacks were all at hand, towel, toothbrush and toilet paper on the dashboard, cameras
                    and mobile phone as well within easy reach. Check, check, double check.

                    It took hours of turning switches, pulling the wagons and platforms up and down the tracks, back and
                    forth to have them all in right position ready for the long journey East. Finally, around 8pm, after
                    seven hours of waiting (talk about an immediate decision making), everything was set and the train
                    took off honking repeatedly, taking the endless semicircle track out of Nouadhibou.</p>
