                <h3 class="left">The Events</h3>
                <p class="justify">We had the amazing oppertunity to attend FC Barcelona VS. Rayo Vallecano. We sat amongst tens
                    of thousands of adoring fans as they chanted for the entire 90 minute game. I was amazed by the sheer joy 
                    and dedication these fans had for their club. It was without a doubt one of the most incredible live events
                    I have ever attended. In addition, we got the chance to check out a bull fight. Bull fighting is an incredbily controvesial 
                    part of spanish heritage. We attended the event at the amazing Las Ventas Bullring. 
                    The event itself was a spectacle to behold. The matadors were incredibly skilled and it was unbelievable to see them
                    continually evade such a massive creature. The crowd cheered and clapped to enourage action in the bull ring. It was a brutal 
                    event, but it was certainly an experience I will never forget.

            <div class="content center">
                <p class="justify"> My fascination with Spanish sports led to me noticing new technologies that were being implemented
                    to improve player performance and quality of life. While at the FC Barcelona game, I noticed that the players were 
                    warming up with wearable techonology. The players were wearing vests that were tracking their heart rate, 
                    distance ran, and other important metrics. This data was being sent to the coaching staff in real time. 
                    The football team uses the vests during training to monitor player performance and prevent injuries.
                    In addition to this impressive technology, I discovered that Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies 
                    are being utilized to enhance training methods and fan experiences. Spanish football clubs are experimenting with 
                    VR for immersive training simulations, while AR applications are being developed to provide fans with
                    interactive and engaging ways to experience live sports.
