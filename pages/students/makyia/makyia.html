                <p class="justify"> Throughout my academic career, I have watched groups of students travel abroad and rave about the amazing and beneficial experiences they had. I always wondered when it would be my turn. Ever since graduating high school, I have kept a passport ready, hoping for the chance to study abroad. Now, that moment has finally arrived with the UA MIS 2024 Study Abroad trip!</p>

                <h3 class="left">University of Alabama MIS Study Abroad</h3>
                <p class="justify"> I first heard about the UA MIS Study Abroad trip in late January, and I immediately knew I wanted to participate. I have long awaited the opportunity to study abroad, and what better way to do it than with a program specifically tailored to my major?
                     The prospect of learning more about information technology while immersing myself in a different culture was incredibly exciting.
                    <br><br>
                    Studying information technology in other countries is important for a few reasons. It helps us see how different places use technology and solve IT problems, which can be quite different from what we see in the U.S. This kind of experience makes us more flexible and open-minded about different ways to handle tech challenges. Plus, learning about how international companies deal with different rules and cultural differences gives us useful skills for our future careers. This trip is a great way to get a hands-on understanding of the global IT industry and learn things that we can't get from just studying in a classroom.</p>

    <h3 class="left">Madrid, Spain</h3>
    <div class="content center">
        <p class="justify">First stop, Madrid! On my first day, I wandered the city endlessly with the help of Google Maps, without any particular destination. This allowed me to truly absorb the culture and immerse myself in the local atmosphere. Once the program began, we had a welcome dinner as a group, trying a wide variety of Spanish tapas. This was a fantastic introduction to Spain, letting us actually taste the foods and experience the different combinations of dishes that Spaniards enjoy.
            <br><br>
            Throughout the week, we participated in various activities such as a walking and tapas tour, a Royal Palace of Madrid tour, a Prado Museum tour, a flea market visit, a stroll through Retiro Park, and a tour of the Monastery of Las Descalzas Reales, among others. Madrid is an incredibly busy city with so much to see that a week isn’t nearly enough to cover it all. I loved the scenery, trying new things, exploring different transportation systems, and attempting to communicate with people who spoke a different language and had different mannerisms.
            <br><br>
            My favorite area to explore in Madrid was Sol, the "center of the city." It always had a lively buzz that I enjoyed. My favorite site was the Royal Palace, which was one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen, filled with rich history. My favorite tapa was, without a doubt, croquettes—I could eat them forever. I also really enjoyed the way they cook prawns.
            <br><br>
            One of the most distinctive aspects of Spanish culture I experienced was the tradition of the siesta. In Spain, many businesses, shops, and restaurants close down for a few hours in the afternoon, typically from around 2 PM to 5 PM, allowing people to take a break and rest. To fully immerse myself in the culture, I embraced the siesta lifestyle. Each afternoon, I took the time to rest and recharge, just like the locals. This not only helped me adapt to the new environment but also provided a refreshing pause in the midst of busy days filled with exploration and activities. Adopting the siesta tradition gave me a deeper appreciation for the Spanish way of life and its emphasis on well-being.
            <br><br>
            Reflecting on my time in Madrid, I realize how much this city has enriched my experience. The blend of historical sites, vibrant neighborhoods, and delicious cuisine provided a perfect introduction to Spanish culture. Each activity, from touring majestic palaces, taking siestas, to enjoying casual tapas, offered a deeper understanding of the city's unique character. My adventures in Madrid have not only broadened my cultural horizons but also left me with lasting memories of a city that seamlessly combines tradition with modernity.

    <h3 class="left">Barcelona, Spain</h3>
    <div class="content center">
        <p class="justify">Next Stop, Barcelona! From the moment we stepped off the train and onto the bus to begin our tour, I was captivated. Barcelona embodied everything I adore in life and surpassed my expectations for a destination. Driving through its streets, I was mesmerized by the coastal trees, lush greenery, and the distant silhouette of mountains lined by palaces and cathedrals. Barcelona felt like a dream come true. Bursting with excitement, I eagerly anticipated what this vibrant city had in store for us. Despite less-than-perfect weather during our stay, Barcelona's beauty remained undiminished.
            <br><br>
            Our itinerary kicked off with a visit to the Montjuic Castle, an unexpected delight. Originally a fortress, it offered panoramic views of the surrounding landscape, a sight both captivating and breathtaking. Another highlight was the Sagrada Familia, a marvel of architecture. Our days were filled with equally enchanting experiences, from a hands-on cooking class to a market tour and tasting, a stroll through the Gothic Quarter, a visit to the Picasso Museum, and a flamenco show. Each activity was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, enriching us with knowledge and unforgettable memories.
            <br><br>
            However, what made Barcelona truly special for me was the simple joy of exploring the city with my classmates. I loved the city's vibrant energy and diverse scenery. Barcelona's tourist-friendly atmosphere and multilingual environment also made navigating the city a breeze. I also found joy in the city's unique blend of urban charm, coastal beauty, majestic skylines, and serene mountains.
            <br><br>
            As I bid farewell to Barcelona, I couldn't help but feel a little sad, wishing I could extend my stay indefinitely. The memories created and the lessons learned in this remarkable city will forever hold a special place in my heart, reminding me of the profound beauty and cultural richness that Barcelona embodies. I hope to return soon!

                <p class="justify"> During our time in Spain, we visited companies like Siemens Madrid and Inetum to see the technologies they use and how they manage cybersecurity to keep their operations running smoothly. At Siemens, we saw their automation systems and how they protect their infrastructure. At Inetum, we learned about their Security Operations Center (SOC) and their strategies for handling cyber threats.
                    <br><br>
                    We also visited the Autonomous University of Barcelona and attended a lecture by Alex Lozano. He talked about the resources and technologies that help his research and stressed the importance of educating people about cybersecurity. His talk about Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) was really interesting, showing how quickly information can be gathered and used for security.

                    Being abroad taught me a lot about information technology. One of the coolest things I saw was a self-checkout system while shopping. Even though we have self-checkout in the U.S., I hadn’t seen this type before. You place all your items in a bin, and it automatically scans and displays everything on the screen. After confirming the items, you pay and remove the security tags yourself. It was really efficient and fascinating.
                    <br><br>
                    I also noticed that websites in Spain aren't updated as often as they are in the U.S. We often arrived at places listed as open on Google, only to find them closed. This showed me how important it is to keep online information up-to-date.
                    <br><br>
                    Spain’s transportation system is amazing, with a great network of metros, trains, buses, escalators, and elevators. Getting around the city was easy and convenient.
                    <br><br>
                    Another interesting experience was at a restaurant where we used a QR code on our phones to pay the bill. Everyone could select their own items from the check and pay individually through their mobile devices. This made splitting the bill simple and quick, showing a smart use of technology.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, my experiences in Spain have given me a better understanding of information technology and how it’s used in different settings. From cybersecurity and innovative retail solutions to efficient transportation and mobile payment systems, I’ve gained valuable insights that will help me in my future studies and career.UPDATE INFO
