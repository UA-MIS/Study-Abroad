                <p class=" justify">Europe had always been a dream for me, a place I never dared to imagine I'd actually set foot in. So, you can imagine my excitement when the opportunity arose to participate in a study abroad program with the MIS program. I had outrageously high hopes for this trip, yet somehow, it managed to exceed every single one of them. Exploring Madrid and Barcelona, alongside my classmates made the experience even more unforgettable.</p>

                <h3 class="left">Madrid, Spain</h3>
                <p class="justify">Madrid, Spain, stands out as one of the most amazing cities I've ever been to. From the breathtaking beauty of its ancient European architecture to the towering presence of its modern skyscrapers, I was immediately in awe of the striking contrast between the old and the new. We immediately started trying to embrace as much of the Spanish culture as possible! Adapting to the late dinner times proved challenging, but trying all the Spanish Tapas certainly helped ease the transition. My favorite dish on out Madrid tapas tour would have to be the Gambas Al Ajillo, a delicious garlic shrimp dish! Exploring the city, we traversed numerous plazas and covered countless miles on foot. When asked about my favorite tour, there's no hesitation: the Royal Palace of Madrid left an indelible mark. The pictures of this palace do not do it justice! From reading the history on each room to looking up and seeing the amazing paintings on the ceilings, it was an experience I will always cherish!<br><br>During our time abroad, we were privileged to attend a presentation by the SOC team from Inetum, an IT service management company. While I had previously heard of SOC teams in America and their operations, witnessing firsthand how this SOC team operated in Europe was truly fascinating. We engaged in discussions regarding the challenges faced by the company in adhering to diverse policies and procedures across different countries. It was eye-opening to realize that unlike in America, where most states share similar policies, Inetum had to navigate and comply with the distinct policies of each country they operated in. This highlighted the complexities inherent in managing operations across multiple jurisdictions. We also got to dive into their day to day operations. Exploring the concept of "Chasing the sun," they detailed how they outsourced work to individuals in different time zones, like Brazil, ensuring nearly 24-hour service availability for their customers' needs.</p>

            <div class="content center">
                <p class="justify">Barcelona, Spain, has always held a special allure for me, a destination I've longed to explore. From the moment I arrived, I was in awe of its magnificent old European buildings. Moreover, the fact that this amazing city is situated right on the beach only added to its charm. Our time in Barcelona began much like Madrid: indulging in tapas and covering countless miles as we explored its beauty. Without a doubt, my favorite spot was the Sagrada Familia. While you may catch glimpses of this iconic temple in online photos, they hardly do justice to its breathtaking beauty and immense scale. Despite its exterior remaining unfinished, its sheer magnificence is undeniable. Stepping inside, I was awestruck by the completed interior, which was finalized in 2010. The stained glass windows, in particular, captivated me and undoubtedly became the highlight of the interior. Another highlight of the trip was hiking to the mountaintop alongside my classmates to watch the sunset over the city. The view was simply incredible!
                    <br><br>
                   While in Barcelona, we also got to listen in on a lecture from Alex Lozono at the University of Barcelona. Alex Lozono offers specialized services in Open Source Intelligence. His presentation highlighted OSINT and its capabilities. We were in awe of the powers that OSINT had! We were able to see first hand a demonstration on how Alex would do a background check on someone using a software from his company. Within minutes, we were able to discover a lot about the person just by using OSINT! It was amazing and it is an experience I will never forget!

            <div class="content center">
                <p class="justify"> Before coming to Spain, I had never experienced much public transportation. In America, I knew public transportation to be somewhat unreliable and hard to navigate. I expected it to be similar or worse in Spain. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Madrid's public transportation system is without a doubt one of the best in the world. It was easy to navigate and transports thousands of people to their destinations promptly each day. As a foreigner, I feared getting lost and not knowing how to use the metro or the bus. Their system was so efficient that I was able to navigate the city with ease. As soon as you enter the metro, you are greeted with numerous signs that clearly show where you need to go. I believe that the abundance of signs is what makes the metro work so well.
                    <br><br>
                    This became even more apparent upon arriving in Barcelona, where I immediately noticed a difference. Barcelona did not have nearly as many signs as Madrid, and it showed in the efficiency of their transportation system. Barcelona's transportation was not nearly as efficient as Madrid's. In the future, if Madrid implemented software that provided all this information on everyone's phones, I believe it could be even more efficient than it already is.
