                <p class="justify">On this journey I had the pleasure of visitng Madrid and Barcelona, Spain. Plus a sidequeat in the south of france
                    . We were given the oppurtunity to learn about information systems, culture, and international business practices.</p>

                <h3 class="left">¡Hala Madrid!</h3>
                <p class="justify">We began our journey in Madrid, Spain. The country's capital. I quickly realised that from an information systems 
                    standpoint that the city was a marvel compared to many American cities. I enjoyedd getting to use the metro whaich was capable of getting you across 
                    the city in 20 minutes. Additionally some of the metro stations have access to suburban trains to get residents in and out of the city. 
                    In the case that the metro was not a suitible choice, there was also an excellent bus system. I also had the oppurtunity to attend a Real 
                    Madrid game while in the city. I was overly impressed with how smoothly the stadium ran while being in the middle of the city. There was metro
                    stations nearby and even underground parking for those who drive. Additionally the feild can be stored beneath the floor to be able to use the 
                    stadium for different events. We also had the oppurtunity to visit the Inetum office in Madrid, which was the lead office for Inetum's european 
                    operations. They were kind enough to give us a cybersecurity lecture about how their cybersecurity team works. The presentation was given by high
                    level management which was an awardign expieriance. Outside of information systems we gained persspective on different cultures and how international
                    businesses must be able to adapt to their clientel. After a week in Madrid it was time to take the train to Barcelona foe the second leg of our journey.</p>

        <div class="container mt-20 paragraph">
            <h3 class="left">¡Barca, Barca, Barca!</h3>
            <div class="content center">
                <p class="justify"> One of the fist things that I noticed upon arrving in Barcelona was the cultural differance
                    between Barcelona and Madrid. Firstly Barcelona is much older than Madrid once being a port city in the Roman Empire
                    and apart of the catalon kingdom. Everyone in Barcelona speaks spanish and catalon considering themselves spaniards, but 
                    also catalonian. For me this was an example of the importance of understanding culures for an international business. If 
                    you went into a meeting with a Barcelonian business and put a Spanish flag on the table they may prefer a catalonian flag.
                    This made me appriciate international businesses understanding of culture because these are just two cities in the same country.
                    Imagine a continent where they all speak different languages and have differing backgrounds. We got to attened an FC Barcelona game
                    as a group which was held in the 1990's Olympic Stadium while their home stadium was under construction. I was impressed how easy it was to access 
                    this stadium since it has not normally been in use in quite awhile. We took a train to a tram and were dropped off about 100 yards from the stadium.
                    We were able to do this within an hour of the game starting which was very impressive.
                    <br><br>
                    From an information systems standpoint I was also impressed by Barcelona. The metro systems was less impressive than Madrid 
                    which inunderstandable since the city is nestled between the mountians and the coast. But what the city lacked in trains it made up 
                    for with a useful bus system. We were able to take the bus around the city with ease. We also visited the Autonomus University of 
                    Barcelona where we attended a cybersecurity lecture. The professor demonstrated a software he uses in his cybersecurity company. It
                    was interesting to see how his smaller company uses cybersecurity compared to a moster like Inetum..
