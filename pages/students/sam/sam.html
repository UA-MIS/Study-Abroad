              This page is a short summary of my trip to Spain as part of the
              <a href="/index.html">UA MIS Study Abroad Program</a> for Summer
              2024. My tenure in Spain lasted from May 6, 2024 until May 21,
              2024, during which I got to visit two cities, Barcelona and
              Madrid. As a part of the program, I had the chance to experience
              Spain from an academic perspective as well as a traveler's
              perspective, which encouraged me to think critically about what
              was I experiencing. These academic observations as well as my
              personal reflections are captured in the following images, quotes,
              and paragraphs.

            From an academic perspective, perhaps the most interesting facet of
            this trip was the wide difference in modes of transportation in
            Spain vs. the U.S. Both transportation systems have their strengths
            and weaknesses. Furthermore, each mode of transportation is enabled
            by some sort of technology, which differs between each country.

              I feel fortunate to have been able to participate in this study
              abroad program. When Professor Jeff Lucas initially informed me
              about the trip, I hesitated. Not only had I never been abroad
              before, but also I had never really considered studying abroad
              before, just because I hadn't conceived how valuable of an
              experience traveling abroad would be. When I finally stepped out
              of my comfort zone and accepted the challenges of traveling
              abroad, I was pleasantly surprised. Turns out, an international
              trip can be both fun and relaxing.

              It's hard to convey with words the wonder I experienced on this
              trip. The best words I can find are not my own; being a Kansas
              native, it is almost impossible to ignore how fitting L. Frank
              Baum's novel <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> is in describing my reaction
              to setting foot onto Spanish soil.

              My "teleportation" to Spain was indeed quite shocking. However, in
              the spirit of Dorothy Gale and the lesson she learned, this shock
              was arguably good for me, because it pushed me out of my comfort
              zone. The title of this page, "Landlocked", is not just in
              reference to Kansas geography; it also refers to my state of mind
              pre-Spain. I simply didn't know what the outside world was like
              before I went to Spain, so I didn't expect for there to be
              anything worth discovering abroad. Even though I grew up
              landlocked both literally and mentally, after this voyage across
              the Atlantic, my closed perspective about the outside world was
              cracked open.

              I don't know yet what the ramifications of my shifting perspective
              are. As of now, I'm not sure if I want to keep traveling abroad.
              However, with time, perhaps my perspective will change again.
