                <p class=" justify">Being my first time outside of the US, there was a lot for me to take in on this trip. Some of the most notable experiences were communicating in an area where English was not the dominant language, learning about Spanish history and art, and trying the local cuisine. Throughout this study abroad trip, I was not only able to deepen understanding in MIS topics, but experience a new culture for the first time and form lifelong memories with friends.</p>

                <h3 class="left">Tour Guide Technology</h3>
                <p class="justify">One are of technology I’d like to discuss is everything surrounded the guided tours. The guided tours were definitely a highlight of the trip, and it was interesting to learn the tech that supports it. With each tour we were given physical headsets with disposable earbuds. This was highly beneficial because it allowed us to always hear the guided even if he/her was not in close proximity. A general consensus among the students was that the tours were significantly better when you have an expert that can talk through the deeper meaning of an attraction. 

                    One idea I had that could improve this was an app that would allow you to connect your personal bluetooth headphones to hear the guide. This would allow people to have the option of using better quality headphones that may have noise cancellation or improved volume settings. An app could also populate images, potentially controlled by the guide, that would correspond with the experience of the tour. Often a guide would carry an iPad and use it to show the group pictures of related artifacts that support the experience. 
                    
                    A great way to integrate this idea would be to add the functionality to pre-existing tour guide booking apps, like Get Your Guide for example. This would create one seamless tour experience from booking through the tour itself. 
                    
                    The cost associated with this would net negative in the short run due to development costs, but agencies that adopt it first could attract more business at a higher price point. These agencies could also continue to provide disposable headsets that plug into your phone until the general customer base is accustomed to the new technology. </p>

            <h3 class="left">Lectures in Spain</h3>
            <div class="content center">
                <p class="justify">While in Madrid and Barcelona we had the opportunity to meet with various companies/universities. This was enlightening to see the similarities and differences in the technology field in a foreign country. While meeting with Inetum, I got to learn from a leader in the European technology consulting space. With The Autonomous University of Barcelona, I got to learn about a software called Maltego, an open-source cybersecurity intelligence software. This was paticularaly eye-opening as I have yet to see what a cybersecurity professional does on a daily basis. The demonstration also allowed me to have a much greater appreciation for safe cyber practices. Lastly, we had great discussion throughout the trip on cultural differences of working with or in a foreign country. Since such a large percentage of employees have to work with an off-shore team at some point in their career, this was immensely valuable information.

            <div class="content center">
                <p class="justify">The overall trip was an incredibly valuable and insightful experience. There were a variety of other experiences that deserve to be listed here, but I’ll share some of the most memorable for me. I enjoyed getting to see FC Barcelona play fútbol (soccer), touring the Royal Palace of Madrid, touring La Sagrada Familia, and viewing the Picasso museum. The entire trip was jam packed with jaw dropping, breathtaking, and unique events. UA MIS in Spain was good to me, and I hope this blog helps you live vicariously through me!
